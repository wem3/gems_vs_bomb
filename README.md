# gems_vs_bomb
code to analyze intergroup bandit task 

memo to myself:  
you can estimate pGems/pBomb on each trial & compare to ground truth 

It's dark in the cave, and you can't tell whether the other person is a Nyx or a Zur. Both go gems, max payout. Both go sabotage, they cancel out. One and one gems guy gets kaboomed.
