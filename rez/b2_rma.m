If the P result is smaller than 0.05
the Ho tested results statistically significant. Otherwise, it is not significative.
[Generally speaking, no Mean Square is computed for the variable "subjects" since it is assumed
that subjects differ from one another thus making a significance test of "subjects" superfluous.
However, for all the interested people we are given it anyway].
  
The percentage of the variability in the DV associated with the IV (eta squared) is 3.69
(After the effects of individual differences have been removed).
